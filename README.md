🏍️ Superbike Resale Price Predictor
📝 Project Overview
This project allows users to predict the resale price of their superbike based on parameters such as Kilometers driven, Engine capacity, Brand name, and Power (BHP). The prediction model uses the Random Forest Algorithm to estimate the price based on a custom dataset, created by me, where several superbikes' data has been organized.

📈 Model & Algorithm
The model is based on the Random Forest Algorithm, which is an ensemble learning method used for both classification and regression tasks. Here's how it works:

Random Forest builds multiple decision trees during training and merges their results to improve accuracy and control overfitting.

Each decision tree makes a prediction based on different combinations of input features. The final prediction is made by averaging the results of all trees, making the model more robust and reliable.

In this project, the Random Forest model is trained to predict the resale price of a superbike by considering its attributes such as kilometers driven, engine capacity, power (BHP), and brand.

🚀 How to Use
1. Running the Code
You can easily run the code by following these steps:

Download the Jupyter Notebook file.

Open it in your local Jupyter environment or Google Colab.

Run the cells starting from the first one where necessary libraries are imported.

Install Gradio for creating the UI (if not installed).

2. Gradio Interface
Once the Gradio interface is launched, you can input the following parameters:

Bike Name: Select your bike from a dropdown list.

City: Choose the city from the dropdown list where the bike is being sold.

Kilometers Driven: Enter the number of kilometers the bike has been used.

Owner Type: Choose from options like First Owner, Second Owner, etc.

Power (BHP): Enter the bike's power in BHP.

Brand: Select the brand from a list of available brands.

Once you've entered the data, the interface will return an estimated resale price.

3. Result
You will see the estimated price displayed in the UI after entering the relevant details. It's a simple, user-friendly way to get an idea of what your bike could sell for.

🚧 Future Work
KM Driven vs. Brand Analysis: I plan to expand the project to explore the relationship between Kilometers driven and Bike brand. For example, Japanese bikes are often known for their reliability, and as a result, even a moderately driven Japanese 1000cc might retain a higher resale value than a similarly driven European bike (e.g., an Italian 1000cc). I will incorporate this understanding in the future to provide better price predictions based on brand reliability and drive history.
